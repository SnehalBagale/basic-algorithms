Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.
	The user should input a value for n.
	The algorithm should compute the sum using a loop and display the 	result.

=  	Start
	Input: Read an integer n ,n from the user.
	Initialize: Set sum = 0.
	Loop: From i = 1 to n, do:
	sum = sum + i
	Output: Display the computed sum.
	End



Problem 2: Check for Prime Number Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.
	The user should input a value for n.
	The algorithm should check whether the number is divisible by any number other 	than 	1 and itself.

= 	Start
	Input: Read an integer n
	Check Base Cases:
	if n≤1, print "Not Prime" and stop.
	If n=2, print "Prime" and stop (2 is the smallest prime number).
	Loop:
	Iterate from i=2 to root of n: :
	If n is divisible by 𝑖 print "Not Prime" and stop.
	If no divisors found, print "Prime".
	End

Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.
	The user should input three values: a, b, and c.
	The algorithm should compare the numbers and print the maximum value.

= 	Start
	Input: Read three numbers 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 from the user
	Compare: 
		If a is greater than both b and c, then a is the largest.
		Else if b is greater then both a and c then b is the largest.
		Else, c is the largest
	output: print the largest number.
	End


 Problem 4: Factorial Calculation Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

	The user should input a number n.
	The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to 	n.

= 	Start
	Input: Read an integer 𝑛 from the user.
	Initialize: Set factorial = 1.
	Loop: From i = 1 to n, do:
	factorial = factorial * i
	Output: Print the computed factorial.
	End


Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

	The user should input a value for n.
	The algorithm should check whether n is divisible by 2 and display the result as 	either "Even" or "Odd".

= 	Start
	Input: Read an integer 𝑛 from the user.
	Check Condition:
	If n is divisible by 2 (n % 2 == 0),
		 print "Even".
		Else, print "Odd".
	End
